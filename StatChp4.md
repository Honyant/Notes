**Census** - Collection of data from every member of a population usually very expensive in money or time

**Convenience sample** - easy to get (rarely represents the whole pop).

- results in convenience bias.

**Bias** - using a method that is likely to result in an overestimate or an underestimate of the value for the population (not an unlucky sample)

For your answer do one of these:

1. How members might respond different from the general population

2. How this difference would lead to an overestimate or underestimate

**Voluntary response sample** - allows people to self-select to participate invitation (generally people who might feel strongly about an issue - extreme view)

- results in voluntary response bias

They have to take the action to participate- voluntary response bias
