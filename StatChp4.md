**Census** - Collection of data from every member of a population usually very expensive in money or time

**Convenience sample** - easy to get (rarely represents the whole pop).

- results in convenience bias.

**Bias** - using a method that is likely to result in an overestimate or an underestimate of the value for the population (not an unlucky sample)

For your answer do one of these:

1. How members might respond different from the general population

2. How this difference would lead to an overestimate or underestimate

**Voluntary response sample** - allows people to self-select to participate invitation (generally people who might feel strongly about an issue - extreme view)

- results in voluntary response bias

They have to take the action to participate- voluntary response bias

**Stratified random sample** - pop split into groups determined by shared characteristic. Then do a random sample from each group.
Sample upper school St. Marks: 2 freshmen 2 sophomores 3 juniors 3 seniors.
This is more likely to produce a sample mean closest to the population mean bcs every part of pop that could have diff attitude or results is represented.

**Cluster mean** - Population is split into groups (clusters) often geographic in natures. randomly select one or more clusters and use all in those clusters for samples.
Cheaper than random sample. Saving time and money.
