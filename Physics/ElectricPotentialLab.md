Don't have excel so I did this in python

grid resolution $(r): 1.7 cm= 0.017 m$

$E=\nabla V$ at $(x,y)=(\frac{E(x+r)−E(x−r)}{2r},\frac{E(y+r)−E(y−r)}{2r})$

$E_1=\frac{3.4V-3.6V}{2*0.017m},\frac{4.1V-3.6V}{2*0.017m}=(-5.88,14.7) V/m$


$E_2=\frac{1.7V-4.5V}{2*0.017m},\frac{1.6V-3.4V}{2*0.017m}=(-70.6,-52.9) V/m$


The circular, "hollow" neutral conductor causes the electric field to be stronger near the edges of the conductor and essentially zero at the center. The circular conductor becomes polarized due to the field and that in turn causes the field to attract to it. The field is not exactly zero in the center, possibly because the holes in the conductor could lead to the field leaking through.
