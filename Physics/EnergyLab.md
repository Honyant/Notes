## Purpose
For any object in a uniform gravitational field, the potential energy is $U = mgh$. We also know that the translational kinetic energy is $E = 1/2mv^2$. Lastly, we know the rotational kinetic energy to be $E = 1/2I\omega^2$. In this lab, we will experimentally dermine a sphere's moment of inertia by rolling a sphere down an incline, and then measuring the distance traveled when it falls off the edge of the table.

## List of Materials

- Cardboard for incline
- Cardstock for transition to table
- Marking paper
- Different blocks to prop up incline
- Tape
- Table

## Procedure

1. Set up the ramp on top of the table, with tape attach a piece of cardstock to the end of the ramp for the transition to the table.
2. Put marking paper on the ground where the ball is expected to fall.
3. Prop up the incline to a certain height.
4. Put the ball at the top and let it fall until it hits the paper, then measure how far it traveled horizontally.
5. Repeat step #4 three times for each height
6. Repeat steps #3-5 for 5 different heights

## Data Collection


Height of drop = 0.918 m

| Height (m) | Distance travelled horizontally on average (m) |
| -------- | ----- |
| 0.052 | 0.35666 |
| 0.063 | 0.393   |
| 0.085 | 0.45866 |
| 0.1  |  0.50366 |
| 0.114 | 0.54033 |

## Data Analysis


$h_i$ is the height that the ball starts from relative the top of the table
$h_t$ is the height that vertical distance the ball travels as it falls
$d$ is the distance that the ball travels horizontally
$m$ is the mass of the ball
$r$ is the radius of the ball
$v$ is the velocity of the ball as it reaches edge of the table
$f$ is the moment of inertia of the ball divided by $mR^2$

$mgh_i=\frac{1}{2}mv^2+\frac{1}{2}*fmr^2(\frac{v}{r})^2=\frac{1}{2}(1+f)mv^2$
$gh_i=\frac{1}{2}(1+f)v^2$
$v=\sqrt{\frac{2gh_i}{1+f}}$
$h_t=\frac{1}{2}gt^2$
$t=\sqrt{\frac{2h_t}{g}}$
$d=2\sqrt{\frac{h_ih_t}{1+f}}$

$d=\sqrt{h_i}m$
$m=2\sqrt{\frac{h_t}{1+f}}$
$f=\frac{4h_t}{x^2}-1$

We linearize the equation, find m, and solve for $f$

$m=1.678$
$f=4*0.918/1.678^2-1 = \boxed{0.304123}$

The theroretical value of $f$ is $0.4$
Using the error formula, we get a percent error of $23.96925\%$

## Conclusion
In this lab, we fulfilled our purpose of experimentally determining the coefficient $f$ for a moment of inertia $fMR^2$ of a sphere. Our measured value of $f$ is $0.304123$ and our theoretical value of $f$ is $0.4$. We used the error formula to calculate a percent error of $23.96925\%$.


One source of systematic error is the friction between the ball and the table which could cause energy loss.

Another source of systematic error is air resistance, which would cause the ball to slow down and travel less far in the air.
