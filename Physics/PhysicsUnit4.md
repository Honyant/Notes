# Electromag

## Electromagnetism

1. 2 Kinds of charges (positive and negative)
2. Charges experience for according to Coloumb's Law
$\boxed{\vec F =\frac{k q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat r}$

Coloumb's Constant:
$K=8.99\times 10^{9}Nm^2/C^2$
$K=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$
Permittivity of free space:
$\epsilon_0=8.854\times 10^{-12}C^2/Nm^2$

3. Electric charge is always conserved


4. Electric charge is quantized


## Coloumb's Law

Conductor: allows charges to flow through material easily

If you apply an electric field across conductor, the electrons will feel the force

Charge is not free to move through an insulator.

### Charging

Touching: friction

Induction: involves polarization
