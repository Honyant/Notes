# School Notes for 2021-2022

All notes taken in markdown with inline latex.

You must install [this vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath) for viewing latex.

I also used

- [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
- [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)
- [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)

I might also export these markdown files to something else like pdfs or html files.
