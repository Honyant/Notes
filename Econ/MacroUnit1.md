### Ways to calculate GDP


1. Expenditure approach.
2. Income approach. (Wages, rent, interest income, profit)
3. Value added approach.


## Types of Unemployment

1. Frictional - Transitioning between jobs.
2. Structural - Jobs become obsolete.
3. Cyclical - Unemployment caused by recession.

We expect there to be some rate of unemployment from type 1 and 2 unemployment

We want structural unemployment because it is a sign of growth.

Natural rate of unemployment 4-6%

Full Employment


## Metrics for inflation

### Consumer Price Index (CPI)

$$CPI= \frac{Price of Market Basket}{Price of Market Basket in Base Year} \cdot 100$

### GDP Deflator

$\frac{Nominal GDP}{Real GDP} \times 100$

On the PPC, unattainable doesn't actually mean that we can't get to it, it just means that we can't sustain it.

When the economy is at a high, people might not want to invest in, they might prepare for a correction.

### Inflation
