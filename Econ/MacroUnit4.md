## Balance of Payments

When imports are more than exports, we have a trade deficit. Inflow of capital ($X<M$).
Foreign investors have US money, and they find it convenient to buy US goods.
Pros: They have assets tied up in your country, and they want to see you grow.
Cons: They own you.

When imports are less than exports, we have a trade surplus.

$CA$ - Current Account is short term
$CFA/FA$ - Financial Capital Account is long term
Google is the best teacher: **"The current account records the flow of goods and services in and out of a country, while the financial account measures increases or decreases in international ownership assets."*
$CA+FA=0$
