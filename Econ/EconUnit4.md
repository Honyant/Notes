## Shut Down Rule
When total loss > total fixed costs, a firm is better of shutting down.

price < avc means ur making a loss

Chnage in fixed costs, atc rises.

Constant Cost Industry
everyone has the same costs


Rising Cost Industry
j
Descending Cost industry
if oyu are  a profit maximizing company, ayoua re not producing at productive efficiency nor allocating efficiency(you deft 
).



Allocative Efficiency, MC=AR

## Monopolies
>   Profit Max= MR = MC
    Revenue Max = MR = 0
    Allocative Efficiency = MC = AR
    Productive Efficiency = ATC at lowest


# Natural Monopoly
with only half the market as compared to a monopoly, the demand curve will shift left, and the cost will stay pretty much the same, so they cant make any profit at all.

Legal and technical ability to separate hte consumer groups by the following factors:
- Time
- Age
- Income
- Taste
- Gender
- Location
- Consumer type

DISCRIMINATION IS AMAZING- NO MORE DWL

## Monopolistics Competition:
- Numerous Sellers
- differentiated goods
- barriers to entry low

resturants and hotels

- They are unlikely to collaborate with each other

|Number of Firms| Large number|
|Market Power of each firm| Each fimr ash some price making power but less than monopolist's|
|Entry barriers| exist but Low|
|Economic Profits| cannot be sustained beause low barriers to entry|

monopolistically competitive firm starts out as a monopoly
