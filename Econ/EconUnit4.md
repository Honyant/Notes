## Shut Down Rule
When total loss> total fixed costs, a firm is better of shutting down.


Chnage in fixed costs, atc rises.

Constant Cost Industry
everyone has the same costs


Rising Cost Industry
j
Descending Cost industry
if oyu are  a profit maximizing company, ayoua re not producing at productive efficiency nor allocating efficiency(you deft 
).


Allocative Efficiency, MC=AR

## Monopolies
Profit Max= MR = MC
Revenue Max = MR = 0
Allocative Efficiency = MC = AR
Productive Efficiency = ATC at lowest


# Natural Monopoly
with only half the market as compared to a monopoly, the demand curve will shift left, and the cost will stay pretty much the same, so they cant make any profit at all.
