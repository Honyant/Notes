$GDP_R$ vs Price Level

1. Real wealth effect
   1. When prices increase as a whole, people have less power.
2. Interest rates 
   1. Interest rates drop means we spend and borrow more. 
3. Exchange Rate Effect


### AD/AS Shifters:

#### Demand Shifters

**C+I+G+XN**


1. Unexpected Boom in the Stock Market
$C \uparrow AD \rightarrow$
2. Widespread fear of recession
$C \downarrow AD \leftarrow$
3. Increase in transfer payments
$C \uparrow AD \rightarrow$

$X \downarrow M \uparrow AD \leftarrow$
5. Decrease in real interest rates in the US
$C \uparrow I \uparrow AD \rightarrow$

We are about whats likely and directly gonna happen
#### Supply Shifters

- **R**esource Costs
- **A**ctions fo Goverment
- **P**roductivity

1. Increase in nominal wage for workers
$R \uparrow AS \leftarrow$
2. Increase in amount of physical capital
$P \uparrow AS \rightarrow$
3. random and persistent power outages for months
$P \downarrow AS \leftarrow$
4. decrease in corporate taxes on producers
$A \to  AS \rightarrow$
5. Consumers + Businesses expect higher inflation
$C \uparrow AS \leftarrow$
## AD vs AS

At equilibrium, we are at full employment.
