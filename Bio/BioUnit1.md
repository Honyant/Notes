## Taxis vs Kinesis
**Taxis**
- Chemotaxis
  - "White blood cells moving towards a chemical gradient", positive chemotaxis
- Thimotaxis
  - the motion or orientation of an organism in response to a touch stimulus.


**Kensis**
- "Random" Movement
- orthokensis
  - Orthokinesis is a form of kinesis in which the speed of movement of the individual depends upon the intensity of the stimulus. 
- klinokensis
  - Klinokinesis is a behavioral mechanism in which an organism moves toward or away from a stimulus source by altering its frequency of change of direction without biasing its turns with respect to the stimulus field.
- thigmokensis
  - movement in response to touch.
