# Testing Claims About Proportions

**Significance Test:** using observed data to decide between two competing claims

Randomness: random sample

10% -> independent observation -> standard deviation formula gives correct answer
Large counts: $n*p_0 \geq 10, n*q_0 \geq 10$
Gives approx normal distribution

**Standardized test statistic:** $\frac{\mathrm{statistic-parameter}}{\mathrm{SD\ of\ statistic}}$
measures how many SD's the sample statistic is from what we would expect if $H_0$ were true.

$z=\frac{.72-.69}{\sqrt{\frac{.68*.32}{155}}}$

## 4 steps for conducting a significance test

**State:** $H_0,h_a$, define parameter "where p=the true ...", "using $\alpha=$ ..."
**Conditions:** Randomness, 10%, L. Counts
**Do/Calculate:** evidence $\hat p=\_\_\_\_<p_0$, standardized test statistic, drawing, P-value
**Conclusion:** **"bcs the P-value  of __ < or >  \alpha=___, we can reject the null hypothesis. There is convincing evidence to support the alternative hypothesis."**

If there is no evidence, then don't do the hypothesis test at all!
Say that **"bcs $\hat p = \_\_ <.7$, there is no evidence to support the claim."**

State:

$H_0=30.1$
$H_a \neq 30.1$
$Âµ=$ percent of numbers in financial records that begin with the digit 1

Conditions:
