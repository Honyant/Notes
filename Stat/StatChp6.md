**Random Variable:** take on numeric values in response to a random process.
x=# of H in 5 tosses 
Y+ Sum of two dice
H=Height
S=Shoe size

**Probability Distribution:** All the possible values of a random variable and their associated probabilities.

**Discrete random variable:** Takes on a fixed set of values with gaps between the values.
Height would not be on the list.

Probability Distribution needs to add up to 1



subtract 2 probability dists: 
$\sigma_{x+y}=\sqrt{\sigma_{x}^2+\sigma_{y}^2}$
$\mu_{x+y}=\mu_{x}-\mu_{y}$


$\mu_b=153,\mu_c=832.5$
$\sigma_b=32,\sigma_c=103$
$\sigma_{b+c}=\sqrt{\sigma_b^2+\sigma_c^2}$
=(32^2+103^2)^(1/2) = 107.8563859954523
$\mu_{b+c}=\mu_b+\mu_c$=153+832.5 = 985.5
