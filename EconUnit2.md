# Price elasticity

$PED=-\frac{\% \Delta Q_d}{\% \Delta P}$

$\% \Delta Q_d $ and $\% \Delta P$ always opposite signs

top of the demand curve is ped elastic
bottom is ped inelastic even when you drop the price $50\%$, demand barely changes

Think of inelastic as ppl really want it and $PED < 0$

Determinants of PED

1. The available of substitutes: if the price of something else is better, you buy that better cheaper thing.

2. Time span - more time, more time to find substitutes

3. The proportion of income spent on the good, the more the \% of income spent on the good, the greater the demand is relatively price elastic.

The percent change is greater in the x axis at higher axis at low x values, percent change is lower in the y axis at higher axis at low y values,

**S**-substitutes(more substitutes=more elastic)
**P**-proportion of income(large proportion=elastic)
**L**-luxury or necessity(necessity=inelastic)
**A**-addictive(inelastic)
**T**-time passed(over time=more elastic)

If ur product is inelastic, price should be raised
If ur product is elastic, price should be lowered

# Profit equation

$\pi=T_R-T_C$

Example:
$T_C=500$
$T_R=P \times Q =400 \times 100$
$\pi=-100k$

$1550 \times 500=775,000$
$775,000-500,000=225,000$

# XED: comparative

$XED=\frac{\%\Delta Q_A}{\%\Delta P_B}$

Price pepsi, goes up, price of coke cokes up, $XED$ is positive

If price of hamburgers go up, then the demand for buns goes down, so XPED=-1, and they are complements

$CPED$ or $XED$ or $XPED$

if $XPED=1$, strong substitute,

$XPED=-1$, complement good

# YED

**Income Elasticity of Demand** measures the responsiveness in the quantity demanded for a good or service when the real income of the consumers is changed

$YED=\frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta Y}$

>**0-1:** Inelastic
 demand for the good is relatively unresponsive to changes in consumer income
**1:** unit elastic
**\>1 :** Elastic

### Normal goods $YED>0$

- Necessity: $YED \in (0,1)$
  - Cigarettes
- Luxuries: $YED>1$
  - Cuban Cigars

### Inferior Goods $YED<0$

- Demand falls as income rises
- Superior substitutes available
(potatoes, really cheap underwear)

# PES

$PES=\frac{\%\Delta Q_S}{\%\Delta P_S}$

1. Time
   A. if you have to sell the fish rn, you have low PES
2. availability of producer substitutes
   B. no close substitutes $\implies$ lower PES

3. extent of excess capacity
4. use of skilled or unskilled

## Who is paying the tax

$\frac{\% \mathrm{consumer \space incidence \space tax}}{\% \mathrm{producer \space incidence \space tax}}= \frac{PES}{PED}$

PED more elastic, then the producers pay more of the burden

PES more elastic, then the consumers pay more of the burden

This is only works on a shift on supply curves.

Tip: just look at before and after, and determine how much producers pay now vs how much they pay later as well as for consumers.

### Maximizing Utility

Good a is 20$ an hour

Consumptions possibility frontier
(various combinations of wonda and clorine that the customer could consume)
(customer should be equivalently happy on any point on the line)
Employ the equimarginal principle.
$$\frac{Mu_x}{p_x}=\frac{Mu_y}{P_y}$$
last dollar that you spend, is equal to the last dollar you spend on the other good, that when you know when to stop.

waiting time is also a cost
