# Randomness and Probability

Law of large numbers: If we observe more and more repetitions of and random process, the proportion of times that a specific outcome approaches that probability of that outcome

expected/predicted % of successes in many, many trials.
Prob is between 0 and 1, 0 means impossible, 1 means guaranteed.
Beware of scientific notation.

If we roll 2 dice many, many times, the expected proportion of times where the sum is 7 is about 1/6.
