## Vocab

**Marginal costs (associated with supply)**: increase with production

**Marginal benefits (associated with demand)**: as you buy more, the marginal utility decreases.

**Externality** : a type of market failure (fails to allocated resources at the socially optimal amount)

Marginal Social Benefit and Marginal Social Cost.

The **externality**: When third party gets affected by a market transaction.

The MSC a parallel line above the marginal cost curve: this is the marginal social cost curve.

Marginal Private Benefit and Marginal Social Benefit.

If we consider the new social equilibrium, its the intersection of MSC and MPB.

Need to tax polluting companies to make them aware of the cost.

A negative externality exists when a cost spills over to a third party. 
A positive externality exists when a benefit spills over to a third-party.

A **Pigouvian tax** solves the problem of a negative externality just with a simple tax.

**Cap and trade:**
Have a decreasing cap on the amount of pollution produced, but give them tradable allowances to pollute.

*Noise pollution:* as long as property rights are clearly defined, we know who has the rights to a quiet place and they can reach a monetary agreement.

*General pollution:* transaction costs are high and property rights are not clearly defined.

Coase theorem: we can resolve the problem bcs rights are well defined and not much money has to change hands.

**Market failure:** MSB!=MSC

**Merit good:** a good that can potentially produce a positive externality.

**Demerit good:** a good that can potentially produce a negative externality.
Clear demerit good: ciggs

**Free-rider problem** : disincentivises people from doing a transaction because they already get it for free or they expect to get it for free. (MPB demand is to the left of MSB demand).

Non-excludable: once provided use cannot be limited


## Ways to identify and address market failure

### Externalities exist

- negative externality of production
- negative externality of consumption
- positive externality of production
- positive externality of consumption

### Governmental intervention (to negative externalities)

- Ban
- Price controls
- Quantity controls

However, these are inefficient economically.
### Market friendly

- pigouvian tax
- subsidies or voucher
- cap and trade

### Market pure

In a sense, implement policies that make it possible for private entities to solve these problems on their own. (apply coase theorem)

1. establish clear property rights
2. lower transaction costs

## Types of goods

||Rivalrous in consumption|Non-rivalrous in consumption|
|---|---|---|
|Excludable|**Private goods** (chewing gum)|**Artificially scarce goods** (swimmming pool, golf course)|
|Non-Exludable|**Common access goods** (Congested Roads, fish in the sea)| **Public goods** (lighthouse, national defense)|

Government can supply public goods.

**Excludable:** you can prevent someone having access if they don't pay.

**Nonexcludable:** you can't prevent someone from having access if they don't pay. (these goods are often underproduced)

---
**Nonrivalrous in consumption:** more than one person can consume the same good at the same time.

**Rivalrous in consumption:** someone consuming prevents someone else from consuming the same good at the same time.

Common goods: leads to the tragedy of the commons.
# Theory of the firm

## Intro to costs, revenues, profits
profit=$\pi=T_R-T_C$
Revenue=What comes in $=P \times Q$
Cost=What goes out

Accounting costs $\neq$ economic costs

**Firm** is an enterprise that brings in land labour capital and entrepreneurship.
tries to make a profit.

MAXIMIZE PROFIT by minimizing COSTS and maximizing REVENUE.

**Explicit costs:** Direct costs you see on an accounting sheet.
**Implicit costs:** Opportunity costs.
$T_C=E_C+I_C$

### Types of Profit!!
**Accounting profit:**  $T_R-E_C$ Total revenue minus explicit costs. 

**Economic profit** (we want this): $T_R-T_C$ This is also accounting profit-implicit costs.
**Normal profit:** $\pi=0=T_R-T_C$ If a firm makes this, it has a reason to stay in business. $T_R=T_C$
**Abnormal profit/Supernormal profit:** Economic profits made in excess of normal profit.


- Farmer Brown typically earns $20/hour for banjo lessons
- One day, he spends 10 hours planting $100 worth of seeds.
- What is his opportunity cost/implicit cost?200 dollars of banjo
- What is his explicit cost/accounting cost? 200-100
- If the seeds yield $200 worth of crop, what sort of profit does he make?100
- 
- Accounting profit? 100
- Economic profit?-100
